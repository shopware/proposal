# Proposals for Shopware 6.5.0.0

In this proposal we are collecting breaking change topics for the next major version. 
This list is still in work and not **final**.
We want to collect with this repository the feedback from the community and include your topics into the next major. 
Ofcourse not all topics are possible to integreate, for this reason we have to priorize any topic by need and the effort. 
For this reason please use the reactions on the issues to upvote it.
